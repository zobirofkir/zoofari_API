User Management System with MySQL and PHP

This is a simple User Management System that allows you to create users with a username, email, and password. It also provides functionality to retrieve all users from a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin.
Requirements

    PHP (>= 5.6)
    MySQL database (phpMyAdmin)
    Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
    Basic knowledge of PHP and MySQL

Installation

    Clone this repository to your web server's document root folder.

    bash

git clone github:https://github.com/zobirofkir/zoofari_API.git

Import the database schema to your MySQL database using phpMyAdmin. You can find the SQL schema in the database folder of this repository.

Configure the database connection in config.php. Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.

php

    <?php
    // config.php

    $db_host = 'your_database_host';
    $db_name = 'your_database_name';
    $db_user = 'your_database_user';
    $db_pass = 'your_database_password';

    $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);

    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die('Connection failed: ' . $conn->connect_error);
    }
    ?>

    Ensure that your web server is running and configured correctly to serve PHP files.

Usage
Creating a User

To create a user, navigate to the create_user.php page in your web browser.

    Enter the required details (username, email, and password) into the provided input fields.

    Click the "Create User" button.

    The user will be added to the database, and you will receive a success message.

Retrieving All Users

To retrieve all users from the database, navigate to the get_all_users.php page in your web browser.

    A list of all users will be displayed, showing their usernames and email addresses.

Security Considerations

Please note that this is a basic example and not intended for production use without further security measures. For a real-world application, consider implementing the following security precautions:

    Password Hashing: Store passwords securely by hashing them before saving them to the database.
    Input Validation: Implement proper validation for user input to prevent SQL injection and other forms of attacks.
    Authentication: Create a secure login system with proper authentication and session management.
    Authorization: Control user access to certain parts of the system based on their roles or permissions.
    HTTPS: Ensure that your application is served over HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the user's browser and the server.
